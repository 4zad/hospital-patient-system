# Hospital Patient System 

## Description
A massive application I developed to mimic what hospital administrators use to register patients, manage admittance, and deploy resources based on illness severity. It incoporates the use of object-oriented programming and flat file database integration. It was made as a culminating project for my second semester in the CPA (Computer Programming and Analysis) program at Seneca College, in the months of July and August of 2021.

## Inspiration
As COVID-19 took over the world in a sense, life began to change massively for everyone, including myself. As such a massive pandemic, historical event, and point of change in my life I felt that it couldn't be ignored. This hospital patient system is the perfect project to remember all of that and how I learned to program during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Instructions
To run this project, you first need to open a new C++ project in an IDE, such as Visual Studio 2019 (which I used to make this project). You then need to download all the files in this repository and place them in the same directory/folder as the project files. Then you need to add all of the C++ files (files with .cpp extension) into your project, build it, and run the program!
